This repository collects exploratory and applied projects spanning **information retrieval**, **multi-agent orchestration**, **deep learning architectures**, **classical ML**, **workflow automation**, and **algorithmic tinkering**.  

Some projects are polished end-to-end systems; others are **in-progress research prototypes** included to reflect the process of building and iterating.

## üîé Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
- Full pipeline with **web scraping, embeddings, PostgreSQL + pgvector, BM25 and HNSW indexes, hybrid retrieval**, and a **Gradio demo**.  
- Supports **dense, lexical, and hybrid search** with LLM-based answer generation.  
- **Status:** Fully functional, tested end-to-end.  

---

## ü§ñ Multi-Agent System
- Multi-agent orchestration combining RAG with **external APIs (NBA stats)**.  
- Implements **Coordinator, Scraper, Embedding, and RAG agents**, plus domain-specific agents (Stats, Efficiency).  
- **Status:** Fully working demo with group chat protocol and function registration.

## üìà Classical ML & DL Experiments/Explorations
- **FastICA**: Manual implementation **from sctatch with only `Numpy`**. Compared against `sklearn.FastICA`; tested on **my own EEG/ERP data** (colleced in 2022) using metrics such as kurtosis and Q_Q plots, then compared against `MATLAB` `EEGLAB` ICA weights.
- **3-layer Neural Network**: Forward and backward pass and Adam optimizer and dropout manually implemented **from scratch**, tested on `Iris` and `Wine` datasets for accuracy.  
- **Elman RNN**: Forward dynamics implemented **from scratch**; _backpropagation still in progress_, left as an exploratory prototype for furture work.  
- **Seq2Seq with Attention**: Custom **Encoder‚ÄìDecoder LSTM** with explicit **Attention layer**. Includes training loop, batching, gradient clipping, and teacher forcing; _dataset validation still in progress_ <br>
> **‚úÖ STATUS**: Mixed ‚Äî some complete (NN, ICA); some exploratory (RNN, Seq2Seq) and not yet tested on full datasets, scaffolded for extension.

## üì¨ Workflow Automation for _Real-World Problems_
- **Automated Newspaper Submission Script**:  
  - Pulls recent Gmail drafts and parses newspaper name, title, and content (via Google API interactions).
  - Generates `.doc` + `.docx` files automatically.
  - Formats HTML email bodies with word counts and metadata.
  - Sends submissions (with images/attachments) to the correct editorial desk.
  - Deletes the draft once successfully sent.
- **Automated Google Sheet for Clinical Management**:
  - Auto calculates pill counts per week and flags overdose.
  - Integrates **command line** function _within sheet_.
  - Displays and removes images on command.
> **‚úÖ STATUS**: Fully functional. **Solves real-world workflow needs** (family clinical/log management, auto-assisted newspaper submissions).

## üîê Algorithm & Math Explorations
- **SHA-256 implemented from scratch**: bitwise ops, padding, chaining.  
- **Elliptic curve arithmetic**: exploratory implementation of point addition and doubling.  
- Other math/crypto experiments recorded in notebooks.  
- **Status:** Open-ended exploration, intentionally unfinished in parts.

## üöß Note on Project Status
Not every project here is fully polished. Some (RAG, automation) are production-ready demos, while others (Seq2Seq, RNN) are partial implementations included to demonstrate algorithmic curiosity and technical scaffolding. Together, they highlight **breadth, depth, and process**‚Äînot just final results.
