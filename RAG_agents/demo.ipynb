While it may sound complex at first, my goal is to explain the basics in simple, easytograsp language that makes this unique game accessible to anyone. As someone who cut my teeth on classic games like Go in the streets of South Korea, I was fascinated when I recently discovered Kuhn Poker. Developed by mathematicianHarold W. Kuhnin 1950, this strippeddown version of poker has only 3 cards yet still manages to demonstrate important strategic concepts that apply to more complex games. The Deceptively Simple Setup Kuhn Poker is played with just three cards in the deck a King,Queenand aJack. Yup, this has to be the most bare bones card game you ever encountered. Two players ante 1 each to play, and are both dealt one card randomly from the deck. This leaves only card in the deck, that is placed aside. With such a small deck and short gameplay, youd think successful strategies would be straightforward. You would be far from the truth ! Betting Rounds Distilled to a Pure Form The first player can open the betting round by checking or betting 1. Easy so far. If they bet, their opponent can call, match the 1, or fold. If the first player checks, the opponent can still open betting for 1 or also check. When a player folds, the other wins the pot, just like in Texas Holdem. If neither folds by the end, whoever has the higher card wins. This is poker 101. Mixing Math and Bluffing Yet despite seeming simple on the outside, Kuhn Poker is actually game of mixedstrategyNash equilibrium. Wait, what ? This means using chance, not just skill, is part of optimal play. Simply put,there is no pure strategy equilibrium. There is no optimal card counting strategy like in blackjack. For example, say I have the Jack. Math shows I should bet a minority of the time and check a majority of the time to mimize my odds of losing equity long term. ButI can also bluff! If my opponent folds to my random bets, I win even with the lower Jack. Just like in poker right ? So the beauty of Kuhn Poker is distilling gaming to its essence math, psychology and skill all intersect to create a worthy challenge. Randomization using mixed strategies example Ok this may sound complex, but hear me out for a bit. In game theory, randomization using mixed strategies is key to gain an edge over your opponents. This is assuming you are playing a game of imperfect information like poker. Pure strategies create weaknesses because they are exploitable, whilemixed approacheslead to an optimal probabilistic balance. With the latter, players cannot expect to do better byunilaterally deviating.', 'cosine_similarity': 0.8923274406996503}, {'id': 1, 'document': 'doc_1', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn_poker', 'content': 'Contents Kuhn poker Kuhn pokeris a simplified form ofpokerdeveloped byHarold W. Kuhnas a simple modelzerosumtwoplayerimperfectinformationgame, amenable to a completegametheoreticanalysis. In Kuhn poker, the deck includes only threeplaying cards, for example, a King, Queen, and Jack. One card is dealt to each player, which may place bets similarly to a standard poker. If both players bet or both players pass, the player with the higher card wins, otherwise, the betting player wins. Game description Inconventional poker terms, a game of Kuhn poker proceeds as follows Optimal strategy The game has amixedstrategyNash equilibrium when both players play equilibrium strategies, the first player should expect to lose at a rate of 118 per hand as the game is zerosum, the second player should expect to win at a rate of 118. There is nopurestrategyequilibrium. Kuhn demonstrated there are infinitely many equilibrium strategies for the first player, forming a continuum governed by a single parameter. In one possible formulation, player one freely chooses theprobabilityα0,13displaystyle alpha in 0,13with which they will bet when having a Jack otherwise they check if the other player bets, they should always fold. When having a King, they should bet with the probability of3αdisplaystyle 3alpha otherwise they check if the other player bets, they should always call. They should always check when having a Queen, and if the other player bets after this check, they should call with the probability ofα13displaystyle alpha 13. The second player has a single equilibrium strategy Always betting or calling when having a King when having a Queen, checking if possible, otherwise calling with the probability of 13 when having a Jack, never calling and betting with the probability of 13. Generalized versions In addition to the basic version invented by Kuhn, other versions appeared adding bigger deck, more players, betting rounds, etc., increasing the complexity of the game. 3player Kuhn Poker A variant for three players was introduced in 2010 by Nick Abou Risk and Duane Szafron. In this version, the deck includes four cards adding a ten card, from which three are dealt to the players otherwise, the basic structure is the same while there is no outstanding bet, a player can check or bet, with an outstanding bet, a player can call or fold. If all players checked or at least one player called, the game proceeds to showdown, otherwise, the betting player wins. A family of Nash equilibria for 3player Kuhn poker is known analytically, which makes it the largest game with more than two players with analytic solution.1The family is parameterized using 46 parameters depending on the chosen equilibrium. In all equilibria, player 1 has a fixed strategy, and they always check as the first action player 2s utility is constant, equal to 148 per hand.', 'cosine_similarity': 0.8718955149837423}, {'id': 2, 'document': 'doc_1', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn_poker', 'content': 'The discovered equilibrium profiles show an interesting feature by adjusting a strategy parameterβdisplaystyle beta between 0 and 1, player 2 can freely shift utility between the other two players while still remaining in equilibrium player 1s utility is equal to12β48displaystyle frac 12beta 48which is always worse than player 2s utility, player 3s utility is1β24displaystyle frac 1beta 24.

While it may sound complex at first, my goal is to explain the basics in simple, easytograsp language that makes this unique game accessible to anyone. As someone who cut my teeth on classic games like Go in the streets of South Korea, I was fascinated when I recently discovered Kuhn Poker. Developed by mathematicianHarold W. Kuhnin 1950, this strippeddown version of poker has only 3 cards yet still manages to demonstrate important strategic concepts that apply to more complex games. The Deceptively Simple Setup Kuhn Poker is played with just three cards in the deck a King,Queenand aJack. Yup, this has to be the most bare bones card game you ever encountered. Two players ante 1 each to play, and are both dealt one card randomly from the deck. This leaves only card in the deck, that is placed aside. With such a small deck and short gameplay, youd think successful strategies would be straightforward. You would be far from the truth ! Betting Rounds Distilled to a Pure Form The first player can open the betting round by checking or betting 1. Easy so far. If they bet, their opponent can call, match the 1, or fold. If the first player checks, the opponent can still open betting for 1 or also check. When a player folds, the other wins the pot, just like in Texas Holdem. If neither folds by the end, whoever has the higher card wins. This is poker 101. Mixing Math and Bluffing Yet despite seeming simple on the outside, Kuhn Poker is actually game of mixedstrategyNash equilibrium. Wait, what ? This means using chance, not just skill, is part of optimal play. Simply put,there is no pure strategy equilibrium. There is no optimal card counting strategy like in blackjack. For example, say I have the Jack. Math shows I should bet a minority of the time and check a majority of the time to mimize my odds of losing equity long term. ButI can also bluff! If my opponent folds to my random bets, I win even with the lower Jack. Just like in poker right ? So the beauty of Kuhn Poker is distilling gaming to its essence math, psychology and skill all intersect to create a worthy challenge. Randomization using mixed strategies example Ok this may sound complex, but hear me out for a bit. In game theory, randomization using mixed strategies is key to gain an edge over your opponents. This is assuming you are playing a game of imperfect information like poker. Pure strategies create weaknesses because they are exploitable, whilemixed approacheslead to an optimal probabilistic balance. With the latter, players cannot expect to do better byunilaterally deviating.\n",
      "Document 2: Contents Kuhn poker Kuhn pokeris a simplified form ofpokerdeveloped byHarold W. Kuhnas a simple modelzerosumtwoplayerimperfectinformationgame, amenable to a completegametheoreticanalysis. In Kuhn poker, the deck includes only threeplaying cards, for example, a King, Queen, and Jack. One card is dealt to each player, which may place bets similarly to a standard poker. If both players bet or both players pass, the player with the higher card wins, otherwise, the betting player wins. Game description Inconventional poker terms, a game of Kuhn poker proceeds as follows Optimal strategy The game has amixedstrategyNash equilibrium when both players play equilibrium strategies, the first player should expect to lose at a rate of 118 per hand as the game is zerosum, the second player should expect to win at a rate of 118. There is nopurestrategyequilibrium. Kuhn demonstrated there are infinitely many equilibrium strategies for the first player, forming a continuum governed by a single parameter. In one possible formulation, player one freely chooses theprobabilityα0,13displaystyle alpha in 0,13with which they will bet when having a Jack otherwise they check if the other player bets, they should always fold. When having a King, they should bet with the probability of3αdisplaystyle 3alpha otherwise they check if the other player bets, they should always call. They should always check when having a Queen, and if the other player bets after this check, they should call with the probability ofα13displaystyle alpha 13. The second player has a single equilibrium strategy Always betting or calling when having a King when having a Queen, checking if possible, otherwise calling with the probability of 13 when having a Jack, never calling and betting with the probability of 13. Generalized versions In addition to the basic version invented by Kuhn, other versions appeared adding bigger deck, more players, betting rounds, etc., increasing the complexity of the game. 3player Kuhn Poker A variant for three players was introduced in 2010 by Nick Abou Risk and Duane Szafron. In this version, the deck includes four cards adding a ten card, from which three are dealt to the players otherwise, the basic structure is the same while there is no outstanding bet, a player can check or bet, with an outstanding bet, a player can call or fold. If all players checked or at least one player called, the game proceeds to showdown, otherwise, the betting player wins. A family of Nash equilibria for 3player Kuhn poker is known analytically, which makes it the largest game with more than two players with analytic solution.1The family is parameterized using 46 parameters depending on the chosen equilibrium. In all equilibria, player 1 has a fixed strategy, and they always check as the first action player 2s utility is constant, equal to 148 per hand.\n",
      "Document 3: The discovered equilibrium profiles show an interesting feature by adjusting a strategy parameterβdisplaystyle beta between 0 and 1, player 2 can freely shift utility between the other two players while still remaining in equilibrium player 1s utility is equal to12β48displaystyle frac 12beta 48which is always worse than player 2s utility, player 3s utility is1β24displaystyle frac 1beta 24. It is not known if this equilibrium family covers all Nash equilibria for the game. References External links\n",
      "LLM answer:\n",
      " Kuhn Poker is a simplified form of poker that demonstrates important strategic concepts despite its deceptively simple setup. The game is played with only three cards in the deck (King, Queen, and Jack) and two players ante 1 each to play. Each player is dealt one card randomly from the deck, leaving only one card remaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game has a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, meaning that using chance, not just skill, is part of optimal play. There is no pure strategy equilibrium, and players must use bluffing and randomization to gain an edge over their opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple terms, Kuhn Poker is a game where two players are dealt one card each from a deck with only three cards (King, Queen, and Jack). They can bet or check, and the player with the higher card wins. However, the game requires strategic thinking and bluffing to win, making it more complex than its simple setup suggests.\n",
